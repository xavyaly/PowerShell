In Linux we called command and in Powershell we call cmdlets

In Mac:
cd ./		: 	Move to different drive
dir		: 	list all directories
clear	: 	clear the screen
ifconfig	: 	List all IPs

Note:
Powershell is an Object based scripting language

4 commands:
Get-Help			: 	Help File 
Get-Command	: 	List all cmdlets
Show-Command	: 	Didnâ€™t work on Mac
Alias			: 	Later

Next Commands:
Get-Host				: 	Powershell Version
Update-Help -Force  	:  	Every time you need to run this command
